## Question

> The [numbers](the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?

### Hint

> The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

## Solution

This flag is solved with an A1Z26 cipher, where numbers correspond to the letter positions in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.)
Doing this for the numbers in the picture gets:

```
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }
p  i c o  c t  f { t  h e n  u  m  b e r  s  m  a s  o  n  }
```
